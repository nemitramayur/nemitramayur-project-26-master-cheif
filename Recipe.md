Method:

1. Chop the mangoes . remove it from the skin using a spoon which is the most comfortable way. Then just squeeze out the extra pulp from the seeds. 
2. Now add the pulp in a sieve. The excess moisture which will drain out will help reduce the water content in the ice cream which in turn will help us reduce the forming of ice crystals in the ice cream. 
3. Next, without using a single drop of water grind the mangoes into a puree.
4. Now in a bowl add 2 cups of mango puree & mix 3/4 cup of condensed milk. You can use 1 cup too as per your taste. Mix really well & check for sweetness. If the sweetness is good for you then do not add any sugar. If you want more sweetness you can add in powdered sugar as per your choice and taste, also remember that 
the cream we will be using is also already sweetened. The sweetness of mangoes also plays a big role. 
5. Now in another bowl add the whipping cream. Use a whisk or a electric blender to whip the cream until stiff peaks. The whisk will take you about 15 minutes but the electric beater reduces the time drastically.
6. Once the cream is whipped , gradually add in the mango mixture. mixing the mixture slowly ensure that the cream does not lose its air which is very important. You can use cut & fold method to fold in or just simply mix slowly. 
7.you can Use a whisk to smoothen out the mixture before transffering it to the other container .
8. Now use a metal, glass or plastic container to set the ice cream. (just transfer our mango mix into the container slowly )
9. Add in some chopped mangoes and mix gently. (OPTIONAL)
10. Cover with a plastic wrap & make sure that it touches the ice creamâ€™s surface. This will ensure that no ice crust is formed on top. 
11. Freeze your ice cream for at least 4 hours or overnight. 
12. Remove you ice cream and rest it for 5 minutes before serving. You can serve it with some fresh mangoes.
